# Days of Code #2 Infinite Scroll

SURPRISE MUTHAFUCKAS! I actually made it beyond day one in my Challange. 
This time the project is quite basic and I didnt really put any effort into the CSS, but I did apply something new and something
I dont quite understand (yet) but it did turn out actually working.


## WTF is this?
Based on [Steve Griffiths video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EeVzn02grw&t=638s) I built a web page that fetches the same 4 images from given API over and over again infinitely using JS Intersection Observer and Fetch requests.

## What was used?
- ES6 fancy fetch methods, promises and all that async mumbo-jumbo used to fetch data using API's
- HTML and CSS (SCSS of course)

## What I learned
- A bit about the Intersection Observer
- How to make it to fetch data from a given API on scroll

## What I didn't understand
- How Intersection Observer works exactly and what it actually is

## How can it be improved
- Better UI (loading animation)
- Make it fetch images from other sources (Unsplash API maybe?)
